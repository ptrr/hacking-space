*So, when I'm not programming or playing the piano or gaming you probably find me reading or drinking beer. And primarily reading physics stuff and drinking belgian beer. Here is some of my findings.*

## Binary Universes

Within physics they like to look at the very big and the very small. Physicists are kind of obsessed with it. They look at galaxies smashing together whilst they also like to look at tiny particles, protons, smash together and that's where the Large Hadron Collider comes in. You might have heard of it. As I don't have much faith in humanity sometimes, the sheer size and complexity of the LHC gives me a little hope in humanities ingeniuity.  

For those of you who don't know what happens in the LHC; they are smashing tiny particles together at near the speed of light to find out what they are made of in essence. Physicists are very keen on finding the so called Higgs particle or Higgs Boson particle. A particle of a field called the higgs field which physicists think gives the particles around us their mass. 

So we are breaking down particles to their tiniest possible bits and what then? Think of it, what are those things made of then? What lies beneath that cover? At the tiny scales as for instance at the level we are talking about with the large hadron collider, quantum physics still holds but if we go deeper even that turns in to gibberish and doesn't make sense anymore. 

What do we get then when we break stuff down to it's bare essentials? When it cannot be labeled as matter and energy. What do we get? These questions sometimes keep me up at night. 

I'm not schooled in physics or anything. So I can't really do the math(if there is such a thing at these scales) behind this. Then I stumbled upon this article in the Scientific American, where Craig Hogan, director of the Fermilab Center for Particle Astrophysics, talks about an experiment he is setting up to find out what is and the undividable scale within the universe. 

He goes as far as to suggest that at these tiny tiny scales the universe consists of nothing more then 0s and 1s. Hence the binary nature of the universe. These 0s and 1s make up all the information about the physics in a particular part of the universe. This is what is described as the "information sheet". A term from the "Holographic Principle" which says that a three dimensional world emerges from two-dimensional surfaces that are called Light Sheets. I think this is a cool theory and they are testing this now at the Fermilab institution with what they call a interferometer. An apparatus that was also used to disprove the theory that light and other waves move through a field called the "ether". 

Craig is using this holometer(adapted version of the interferometer) to to find a phenomenon which he calles: holographic noise which if found could point to a binary universe. Well isn't that cool?    

If you are interested and you want to more reading about this I suggest you read his paper about this, which you can find on arXiv: [Interferometers as Probes of Planckian Quantum Geometry](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.4880v27.pdf).

I hope I have been able to interest you a bit. ;) Now on to beer. 

## Beer

{% img left /images/chouffe.jpg  200 %}So this night I had my second *Houblon Chouffe*. My first was some time ago and I didn't had this blog up and running. And I didn't think of reviewing it a bit. So here it is. 

And also the second time around it was awesome. The full bittersweet taste and it's epic foamy collar makes it your worth while, it has to be because it has won the "Europe's Best Imperial IPA" award at the "World Beer Awards" 2010. So there you go, enough reason already to get yourself a bottle (comes in 0.75l bottles).

On the bottle it says "Dobbelen IPA Tripel". A somewhat confusing name maybe, but it refers to the double use of hop (for Dobbelen) and IPA just means Indian Pale Ale. This comes from the use of hop as a preservative for shipping goods to India way back from the Anglo-Saksen brewing world. 

As I am really fond of Belgian beer this truly was a delight. I think I don't have any critism for it. When I first tasted it I didn't add the residual yeast from the refermenting process  but now I did mix the yeast in and I do like it. It gives it more oomph(technical term) so to speak. 

It has quite a punch, so if you have eaten lightly or really not anything at all I wouldn't advise drinking this because it gets you knocked down. But as a dinner or apr&egrave;s dinner beer it works very good. 

For combinations with food; we drank it after some home-made burgers, so with red meat it works well. I think it also combines well with spicy foods as it is quite sweet at first. Haven't tried that yet, but I will for sure. 

I think this concludes my first beer-review. I hope it's has been of value to you and there will be more to come. For now here is some facts about the _Houblon Chouffe_.
