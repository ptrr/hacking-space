So, sitting here, trying to code some stuff, with the cat on my lap, some lounge music on the background and a beer. How can it get better? I have no idea. I've decided to launch this blog or website. Just so I can jot some things down and to have a little project where I can fool around with stuff. 

I don't know if I have so much to say now. But I just will enter this for now.
