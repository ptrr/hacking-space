  <p>I just sort of finished my new site. Not only new code but also new CSS. I&#39;m quite happy with it. </p>
  
  <!-- INTRODUCTION STOPS HERE -->
  
  <p>At first I wasn&#39;t sure if I wanted to use <a href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> or <a href="http://sinatrarb.com" target="_blank">Sinatra</a>. Ruby on Rails is absolutely awesome. It&#39;s very powerful and for me it&#39;s the best MVC framework out there. However, this website isn&#39;t that big and doesn&#39;t have much dynamic content or something that needs to be dredged from a database. So, I picked Sinatra for my website.</p>
  
  <p>Sinatra is, according to their explanation on the website, a DSL for creating web applications with minimal effort. Well, it is true that it doesn&#39;t cost much effort and it&#39;s easily integrated with ruby gems and so forth. </p>
  
  <p>To create a simple app, just do:</p>
  <pre><span class="Comment"># site.rb</span>
  <span class="PreProc">require</span> <span class="rubyStringDelimiter">'</span><span class="String">sinatra</span><span class="rubyStringDelimiter">'</span>
  
  get <span class="rubyStringDelimiter">'</span><span class="String">/</span><span class="rubyStringDelimiter">'</span> <span class="rubyControl">do</span>
      <span class="rubyStringDelimiter">'</span><span class="String">Peter is awesome.</span><span class="rubyStringDelimiter">'</span>
  <span class="rubyControl">end</span></pre>
  <p>and in terminal do:</p>
  <pre>ruby <span class="Special">-rubygems</span> site.rb</pre>
  <p>If you now visit localhost:4567 you will see that I&#39;m awesome. ;)</p>
